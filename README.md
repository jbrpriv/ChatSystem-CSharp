##Overview

ChatApp C# is a modern Windows Forms-based chat application featuring:
- TCP server-client architecture
- MySQL-backed login/signup system
- Real-time user invitation and confirmation
- Discord-inspired dark UI
- Efficient multi-threaded server, handling multiple client tasks concurrently

----------------------------------------

##How to Set Up

1. Clone and Open
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Open the solution in Visual Studio

2. MySQL Configuration
- Run the SQL file named "mysqlConfiguration.sql" included in the project root
  - It will automatically create the required database and tables
- Ensure your MySQL server is running and accessible

3. IP & Database Connection Setup
- Open the main .cs files in both Server and Client projects
- Find and update the following parts:
  IPAddress.Parse("192.168.x.x"); // Replace with your local IP
  MySqlConnection conn = new MySqlConnection("server=127.0.0.1;uid=root;pwd=yourpassword;database=clients");

  Location of these changes: (see IP.PNG screenshot in the images folder)

  Make sure:
  - The IP matches your machine's IP (check with ipconfig)
  - The connection string has your MySQL user, password, and host IP

##How to Run

1. Start the Server
   - Run the Server project in Visual Studio

2. Start the Client
   - Run the Client project
   - Open two or more instances of the Client (on same or multiple machines)

3. Sign Up

4. Online Users
   - Click the "Online Users" button to refresh and view currently available users

5. Send Invitation

##Tips:
